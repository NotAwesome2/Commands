# Commands
Custom commands written for Not Awesome 2

### How do add them to my server?
- Place the .cs file in *extra/commands/source* folder.
- When writing [command name], don't include "Cmd".
- Use `/compile [command name]`
- Use `/cmdload [command name]`

## Cmdadventure.cs
Adds /adventure, which is a quick shortcut for using /map buildable and /map deletable. Can be used by operator+ in any world or by anyone in their /os realm.

## Cmdboost.cs
Adds /boost, which allows you to boost the player's velocity in a given direction. See /help boost for more information.

## Cmdreplacevars.cs
Adds /replacevars, which is like /replace but automatically replaces all of the matching slabs, walls, etc.

## Wait, that's it?
